# linear_regression_with_numpy_and_python
This is my Coursera-guided project, where I got to do all the machine learning without using any of the popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn and statsmodels. In this project, I got to implement all the machinery, including gradient descent and linear regression, of the various learning algorithms. Linear Regression with one variable is implemented to predict profits for a bike sharing startup considering different cities to expand into, for the company which already has bikes in various cities for profits and population from the cities.
